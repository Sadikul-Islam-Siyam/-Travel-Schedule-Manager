# -Travel-Schedule-Manager
The Smart Multi-Modal Travel Schedule Manager (SMTSM) is a JavaFX-based desktop application that helps users plan long-distance journeys using a combination of bus and train schedules. The core idea is to generate all possible travel route combinations, allow the user to pick one, and then save the final trip schedule for future use.
